# Redundant Documentation Archive

This folder contains documentation files that have been consolidated into `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md` to avoid duplication.

## Files Archived:

### **Merged into `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`:**
- **`MVP.md`** - MVP feature list (5 core features)
- **`QUICKSTART.md`** - Quick start guide and development setup
- **`SITEMAP.md`** - Application structure and navigation
- **`progress_summary.md`** - Development progress summary

## Reason for Archiving:

These files contained overlapping information that was causing confusion and maintenance overhead. All the important content has been preserved in the master plan document.

## Current Documentation Structure:

### **Primary Documentation:**
- **`docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`** - Single source of truth for all features and status
- **`PROGRESS.md`** - Current development status (references MASTER_PLAN.md)
- **`background_info.txt`** - Original requirements (Chinese)

### **Unique Documentation (Still Active):**
- **`HEIC_SUPPORT.md`** - Food recognition enhancement
- **`docs/food_image_recognition_guide.md`** - AI implementation guide
- **`TEST_DATA.md`** - Testing scenarios and mockups
- **`docs/beginner_guide.md`** - Learning guide
- **`docs/frontend_architecture.md`** - Technical architecture

## Benefits of Consolidation:

- **Reduced confusion** - Single source of truth
- **Easier maintenance** - Update one file instead of four
- **Better organization** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Improved readability** - All related information in one place

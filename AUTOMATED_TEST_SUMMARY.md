## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Route | First Load | Cached Load | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `/` | ~1233ms | ~247ms | ✅ Good |
| `/content/today` | ~670ms | ~75ms | ✅ Excellent |
| `/quiz?day=1` | ~534ms | ~54ms | ✅ Excellent |
| `/share` | ~3607ms | ~162ms | ⚠️ First load slow |
| `/api/shares` | ~1645ms | ~258ms | ✅ Good |

**Notes:**
- First load times include compilation (expected in dev mode)
- Subsequent loads are very fast due to caching
- `/share` first load is slower due to multiple components + API call
- Production build will be significantly faster

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Quiz Loading Error ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'question')`  
**Cause:** Nested questions structure from database + missing safety checks  
**Fix:** 
- Added safety check for undefined `currentQ`
- Added nested structure flattening in `useQuiz` hook
- Commit: `63b2871`

### 2. Text Sharing Foreign Key Error ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `insert or update on table "text_shares" violates foreign key constraint`  
**Cause:** `group_id` foreign key to non-existent groups  
**Fix:** 
- Dropped foreign key constraint
- Made `group_id` nullable
- API uses `null` for users without groups
- Commit: `cb920ab`

### 3. Text Sharing RLS Policy ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `new row violates row-level security policy`  
**Cause:** Missing or incorrect RLS policies  
**Fix:** 
- Created permissive RLS policies for authenticated users
- SQL executed in Supabase dashboard
- Commit: `fb9246d`

### 4. Next.js 15 Cookies Error ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `cookies() should be awaited before using its value`  
**Cause:** Next.js 15 requires await for cookies()  
**Fix:** 
- Made `createClient` async in server.ts
- Updated API routes to await createClient()
- Commit: `fb9246d`

## 🎯 Test Recommendations

### For Manual Testing:
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Test on mobile viewport (375px)
   - Verify bottom nav usability
   - Check form inputs on mobile

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Try submitting empty share
   - Try very long share content (>500 chars)
   - Try accessing quiz for invalid day (e.g., day 22)
   - Try rapid navigation between pages

3. **User Flow**
   - Complete full signup → login → content → quiz → share flow
   - Verify logout and re-login preserves data
   - Test with multiple users/browsers

4. **Error Handling**
   - Test with invalid credentials
   - Test with unconfirmed email
   - Simulate network errors (disable WiFi briefly)

### For Production:
1. Run `npm run build` to check for build errors
2. Test production build with `npm start`
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Test on real mobile devices
5. Run Lighthouse audit for performance
